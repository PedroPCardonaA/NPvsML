# NPvsML

## Overview

This project aims to compare the performance of some of the most well-known NP problems with machine learning (ML) models. Currently, the focus is on two NP problems: the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the N-Queens Problem.

## NP Problems Being Tested

1. **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
2. **N-Queens Problem**: The objective is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to evaluate and compare the efficiency and performance of traditional NP problem-solving methods with modern machine learning approaches. By doing so, we aim to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in solving complex computational problems.
